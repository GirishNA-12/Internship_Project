{"context": "Pumori (Nepali: \u092a\u0941\u092e\u094b\u0930\u0940, Chinese: \u666e\u83ab\u91cc\u5cf0) (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal\u2013China border in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori, meaning \"the Mountain Daughter\" in Sherpa language, was named by George Mallory. \"Pumo\" means young girl or daughter and \"Ri\" means mountain in Sherpa language.[4] Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as \"Everest's Daughter\".[5] Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his daughter.\n\nPumori is a popular climbing peak. The easiest route is graded class 3, although with significant avalanche danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962, by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition.[3] Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovsk\u00fd and Zden\u011bk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.[6]\n\nAn outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643 metres; 18,514 ft), which appears as a brown bump below the south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will attempt to climb to the top of Kala Patthar. ", "question": "how far is pumori from everest"}
